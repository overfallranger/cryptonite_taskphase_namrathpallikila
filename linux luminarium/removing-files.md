Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I needed to delete a file named delete_me in my home directory and then run the /challenge/check command to verify its deletion and retrieve the flag.

Solution

I listed the files in my home directory using:
ls ~

I deleted the file using:
rm ~/delete_me

I verified the file was deleted by running:
ls ~

I then ran the check command using:
/challenge/check

Flag
The flag I received was:
pwn.college{AwwaVuU67jZhHJQl__9_7L7IWup.dZTOwUDLxAjN0czW}

```bash
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ ls ~
Desktop  a  delete_me  flag
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm ~/delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ ls ~
Desktop  a  flag
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
