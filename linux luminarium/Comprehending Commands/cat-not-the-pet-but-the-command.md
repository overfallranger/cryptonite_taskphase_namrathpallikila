I navigated to my home directory (which was the default starting directory).
I used the following command to read the flag file:
cat ~/flag
Flag
The flag I received was:
pwn.college{wnf4ygZ384OY22yapuMDQAp0TwM.dFzN1QDLxAjN0czW}
```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat ~/flag
pwn.college{wnf4ygZ384OY22yapuMDQAp0TwM.dFzN1QDLxAjN0czW}
```
