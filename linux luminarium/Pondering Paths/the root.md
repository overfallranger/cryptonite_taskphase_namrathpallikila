Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I needed to invoke a program located in the root directory using its absolute path to retrieve the flag.

Solution
I ran the following command to execute the program:
/pwn
Flag
The flag I received was:

pwn.college{cOXocrGUwKt1xY6RSshAhkH6vNy.dhzN5QDLxAjN0czW}
```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cOXocrGUwKt1xY6RSshAhkH6vNy.dhzN5QDLxAjN0czW}
hacker@paths~the-root:~$
```
