I started by SSH-ing into the pwn.college server.
After successfully logging in, I navigated to the /home directory using the following command
cd /home
Once I was in the correct directory, I executed the program using its absolute path:
/challenge/run
The program ran successfully and provided the flag.
Flag
The flag I received was:

pwn.college{4JuyNWmZD9EW4AGLtzr34bUyfJB.ddDN1QDLxAjN0czW}
```bash 
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /home
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/home$ pwd
/home
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/home$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4JuyNWmZD9EW4AGLtzr34bUyfJB.ddDN1QDLxAjN0czW}
