Challenge Overview
In this challenge, the task was to invoke the run program located in the /challenge directory using its absolute path to retrieve the flag.

Solution
I used the following command to execute the program:
/challenge/run
The flag I received was:
pwn.college{QZ8PbWSKGFfK-NXa91yjyysutSL.dVDN1QDLxAjN0czW}
```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QZ8PbWSKGFfK-NXa91yjyysutSL.dVDN1QDLxAjN0czW}
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$
```
