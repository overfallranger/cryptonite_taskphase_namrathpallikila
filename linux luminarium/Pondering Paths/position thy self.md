Challenge Overview
In this challenge, the task was to navigate to the /usr/include directory using the cd command and then execute the run program located in the /challenge directory.

Solution
I used the following commands to navigate to the correct directory and execute the program:
cd /usr/include
/challenge/run
Flag
The flag I received was:
pwn.college{AIdRjn2Zzlbh97G1mqtrndvIBcA.dZDN1QDLxAjN0czW}
```bash
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /usr/include
ssh-entrypoint: /usr/include: Is a directory
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /usr/include
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/include$ pwd
/usr/include
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/include$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AIdRjn2Zzlbh97G1mqtrndvIBcA.dZDN1QDLxAjN0czW}
